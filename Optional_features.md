# Optional features
This file lists a few possible optional features / improvements that could be implemented if there is leftover time at the end of the project but which aren't crucial to the overall functionality of the program (and are thus not part of the roadmap for the strict requirements).

### Fixing question display
There is a NaN value in the column with the indexnames (Question Options NaN)
--> fix this for display purposes

### Categorizing questions
Make it possible to assign a "category" / theme to each question so that e.g. a Quiz generated from the database also only contains questions of a specified category.
