# Advanced python course - quiz project
A simple python project for setting up and running multiple-choice quizzes

## Goal of the project
This project is part of a university course "Advanced python" at the university of Bern and serves primarily to practice the topics covered in said course.
Thus, the product isn't really intended for use by anyone but serves merely as an exercise accompanying the lecture. The description of the project-goals and required features / deliverables was given as follows:

At the moment (as of the 21.11.2021), only Task 1 of the above mentioned subtasks has been completed.
So it is only possible to add questions to a database but not to generate quizes from them yet and track scores etc.
For a more detailled description of the intended timeline for the implementation of the remaining features, please refer to the [ROADMAP](https://github.com/MadpenguinCH/Advanced_python_course_quiz_project/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

## Code organization
At the moment, all code is contained in a single file Quiz.py
To access the quiz database, simply execute said Quiz.py file which will open a text-interface which should guide any user through the process of navigating through the different functionalities.
